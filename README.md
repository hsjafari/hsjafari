Red Team Operator & Python toolsmith. I build adversary-emulation tooling, C2 bits, and automation that doesn’t wake you up at 03:00 AM.

## What I build
- **C2 & operator tools**: tasking, op logs, opsec guardrails, repeatable flows.
- **Loaders & implants**: staged/stageless, selective telemetry, quiet comms.
- **Tradecraft automation**: recon → initial access → privilege → persistence → exfil.
- **Research**: EDR/telemetry evasion, behavioral shaping, sandbox dodging.

## Focus areas
`adversary emulation` · `OPSEC-first engineering` · `EDR bypass R&D` · `Windows internals` · `network tradecraft` · `operator ergonomics`

## Currently
- Hardening a Python C2 core (transport abstractions + opsec checks).
- Prototyping a loader chain with staged AES-GCM and in-memory exec.
- Writing tests that catch the “works on my box” lies.

## Ethos
Only for **authorized** engagements and research. If you’re not the owner or don’t have written permission, don’t touch it.
